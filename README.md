# mjml-component-boilerplate

A boilerplate to quickly get started when creating your own component. 

* Clone the repo
* `npm install` inside
* Add your component inside `components` folder
* `gulp build` when you need to test
* Add your component route to `.mjmlconfig` (make sure to link the one in the /lib folder)
* Use your own component in `index.mjml` or uncomment the `mj-column-image-text` if you want to test the one already created
* `node_modules/mjml/bin/mjml index.mjml` to compile your template !
